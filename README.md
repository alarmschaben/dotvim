# alarmschaben's vim config

This is my personal vim configuration. Perhaps you find it useful.

It uses Junegunn Choi's [plug](http://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) package manager. After cloning to ~/.vim, run

    :PlugInstall

to fetch the plugins and

    :PlugUpgrade

to upgrade vim-plug itself.

A powerline-patched font is favourable, see [here](http://github.com/powerline/fonts) for some of them.
